<p>Fasting in the Armenian Apostolic Church is a deeply spiritual practice rooted in the traditions 
    and teachings of early Christianity. It is not merely an act of abstaining from food but a comprehensive 
    exercise in spiritual discipline, aimed at enhancing one's faith and connection with God. The Church 
    prescribes several periods of fasting throughout the liturgical year, including Great Lent, the Fast 
    of the Nativity, and various shorter fasts leading up to significant feasts. These fasts are observed 
    with varying degrees of strictness, often involving abstinence from meat, dairy, and other rich foods, 
    as well as reducing overall food intake. The purpose of fasting is to purify the body and soul, fostering 
    a spirit of repentance and humility.</p>
    
<p>In addition to dietary restrictions, the Armenian Apostolic Church encourages the faithful to increase 
    their participation in prayer, almsgiving, and acts of charity during fasting periods. This holistic 
    approach ensures that fasting is not an isolated act but part of a broader effort to grow spiritually 
    and morally. The teachings emphasize that the physical aspect of fasting should be complemented by 
    spiritual renewal and ethical behavior, reflecting the comprehensive nature of Christian discipleship. 
    Through fasting, believers seek to draw closer to God, emulate the sacrifices of Christ and the saints, 
    and prepare themselves for the celebration of holy events in the Church calendar.</p>
